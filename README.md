# vmpacking (vmp)

This library implements algorithms for the VM Packing problem as part of my St Andrews Undergraduate Dissertation.
Even though the dissertation has been submitted as of 4 April 2025, this repository is under development.
I hope to continue providing implementations of more algorithms as they come up.

Approximations currently implemented:

* Next Fit
* First Fit
* Greedy Placement by Efficiency
* Greedy Placement by Opportunity-Aware Efficiency
* Tree-Based Placement
* Overload and Remove
* Greedy Placement by Subset Efficiency (Reduction from VM Maximisation)
* Cluster Tree-Based Placement (Reduction from VM Maximisation)

All as credited in the relevant code.

Static treatments:

* Tree-/Cluster Tree-Ordering pre-treatment
* Decanting post-treatment

## Build Instructions

Before building, please make sure your toolchain supports the following:

* CMake 3.14 or newer
* C++ 20 support, including `std::ranges`

Begin by cloning the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/smich42/vmpacking.git
cd vmpacking
```

Create a build directory:

```shell
mkdir -p build && cd build
```

Configure the project (`Release` or `Debug`):

```shell
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Build the project:

```shell
cmake --build .
```

## Important TODOs

* `GuestSelection(size_t, const std::vector<std::shared_ptr<const Guest>> &)` copies the guest vector. As this is an
  intermediate step in the Cluster Tree maximisation algorithm, it likely degrades performance substantially. Refactor
  the code to store only the selection mask for each cluster, and backtrack to reconstruct the guest vector.

* Add simple hand-traced cases as unit tests.
